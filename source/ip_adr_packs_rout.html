                    “The Internet is a network of networks. It links billions of devices together all around the globe”
                    says one of the co-founders of the Internet, Vincent. When we connect to our Wi-Fi, our Internet
                    Service provider then connects us to the rest of the computers on the network that are interconnected.
                    An IP Address is a unique number assigned to each device on the network. It is what allows other
                    devices connected on the network to send information to your device. However, all devices on the
                    network have to follow the same protocol, which in this case is the Internet Protocol. Hence, “a
                    computers address is called an IP address” says Vincent. If a computer connected to the internet,
                    visits a website, then it is just sending a message to the other computer with its IP address attached
                    so the other computer can know where to send the information back to. An IP address can be related to
                    someone’s physical address in the sense that the IP address is like someone’s house address. In order
                    for a mail carrier to deliver a package or letter correctly everyone must follow the same protocol, or
                    in other terms the same style for writing addresses. IP addresses are written in such a way that there
                    are 4 numbers each separated by a period. Each of these numbers represent something different and hold 8
                    bits of information each. This means that an IP address holds 32 bits of information. An example of an IP
                    address would be “123.456.78.90”. The first set of numbers identify the country of the device. The second
                    set of numbers identify the region of the device. The third set of numbers identify the subnetwork and finally
                    the last set of numbers identify the specific device. However, most numbers these days don’t specify countries
                    they just specify networks and subnetworks as a whole, but are still put in 4 different sets. Since there are
                    4 different sets of numbers, this is called IPv4 and was designed in 1973 and used everywhere by the 1980’s.
                    IPv4 also provides almost 4 billion unique IP addresses to devices connected on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a big problem though. At some point there will be need for more unique IP address but there won’t
                    be enough unique addresses remaining. IPv6 is currently being worked on which uses 128 bits per address and
                    provides 340 undecillion unique IP addresses.

                            In order for poeple to deliver mail or a package to someone they must know they real physical address.
                            If not, then your mail will never reach its destination. Similarly, a browser trying to access a website
                            will need to connect using the website's IP address.

                    The way information gets sent over the Internet isn’t as straightforward as sending a request to a
                    server and getting information back. As information gets sent over the internet to its destination
                    it can take various paths, always trying to find the faster route. Also the information that gets
                    sent over the internet travels as a packet of information. These packets hold pieces of information
                    from the original data or information that is being sent over the Internet. Once all these packets
                    arrive at the destination, they merge together to form the original data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Routers keep track of all the routes for sending packets over the internet. It also chooses the cheapest
                    path for each packet to travel on. In the case where some packets get lost or a router stops working,
                    then there are other paths which the packets can take to reach the destination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make sure all the packets are delivered correctly, they follow the Transmission Control Protocol,
                    or TCP. TCP is in charge of making sure all packets have been delivered and if it notices that some
                    packets are missing then the original sender will resend packets. The more routers that are added to
                    the network the better the network becomes.

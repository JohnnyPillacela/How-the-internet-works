                    Domain Names and ICANN
                    Domain Names are readable IP addresses for humans. For example, Metaphorically, it is very similar
                    to how you would scroll to a contact in your cell phone rather than manually dialing the person by
                    entering their full phone number; the phone number would be an IP address and the saved contact would
                    be a domain name.” says the website Domain.com. Since people can’t be bothered to remember someone’s
                    whole phone number, they find it by contact name. Similarly, since people cannot be bothered to
                    remember a website’s IP address, they just remember the domain name. In a more literal way, when
                    someone try to access a website by typing a website’s domain name, the domain name gets sent by your
                    computer to a Domain Name System Server where it tries to pin point the location of that domain and
                    returns an IP address. Once the IP address is received, then your computer knows where to go to access
                    the servers of wherever you were trying to connect.

                <p class="par_start">
                    But, what if there are two same domain names or two same IP Addresses? How would my computer know
                    where to go? Well there would never be any duplicates. This is thanks to ICANN, which is a non-profit
                    organization that coordinates the Internet’s naming system. According to ICANN, “ICANN doesn’t control
                    content on the Internet. It cannot stop spam and it doesn’t deal with access to the Internet.” They
                    just control the naming system. They were formed in 1998 and they dedicate themselves to keeping the
                    Internet secure, stable and interoperable. Once again, ICANN helps coordinate the supply of IP addresses
                    and they do not supply IP Addresses. They just make sure IP addresses aren’t duplicated. Also it is in
                    their name, Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.

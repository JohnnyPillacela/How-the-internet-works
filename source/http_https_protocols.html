                    How do computers talk to each other when websites are requested by a user? This is called HTTP,
                    or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. According to Dave, the founder of Tumblr., says that, “it is the
                    language that one computer uses to ask another computer for a document”. If everyone uses the same
                    protocol, then everyone can connect to each other. HTTP is very simple in that it has a statement
                    called “Get” followed by the actual address of the site a user might be searching for. When a request
                    is sent then the information sent to a server is search for and returned to the user. Since information
                    on the Internet is public and mostly shared by plain text, it is easy for hackers to read private
                    information. A way around this is by having computer communicate using Secure Sockets Layer and
                    Transport Layer Security. SSL and TLS can be thought of as a protection around your information
                    when it is being sent over the Internet. A way to make sure SSL and TLS are being used in the
                    transfer of your information over the Internet, users have to make sure a green lock is next to
                    the HTTPS browser address bar. HTTPS is the almost the same thing as HTTP except it is Secure. It
                    stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. If a server is trying to establish a secure
                    connection with your browser, a Digital Certificate must be provided by the server. If not, then
                    the browser will most likely show a warning of how the server is not secure. A way a server can
                    obtain a Digital Certificate is by being given one by Certificate Authorities, which are trusted
                    entities that verify the identities of websites.

                            In this screenshot that I took, the google chrome browser is telling me that this website is
                            secure and that it is also ussing the HTTP protocol.

                    Websites are very vulnerable but so are e-mails, messages, and regular people who use the Internet.
                    Sometimes we may accidently clicked on an e-mail that looks legit, but it is actually a scam and
                    download whatever they are offering. Maybe the user provides the sender of the email with private
                    information. Sometimes hackers send out computer viruses that can quickly spread out to other computers.
                    Sometimes hackers used these computers to start a Distributed Denial of Service on websites. When
                    this happens, websites are being filled with billions of requests at a single time, making the
                    website unresponsive.
